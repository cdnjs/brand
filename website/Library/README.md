# Library


### Hero

This library page is not the most inspiring page, but we needed an agreement between design and functionality. The hero content itself serves most of the information the current one does, with exceptions for some information perceived "not important" by an anonymous group of developers (cdnjs users and random non-cdnjs users). I did not want to exclude any information, but the integrity of the content on the page was more important.

Everything on this section is as it is seen, nothing fancy.


### Version

The version dropdown here is the same as the current, but with a different styling to fit the brand.


### File

The file system here is different, and a work in progress like the Libraries page cards. The page needs to consider copying Link, Script, SRI code, and SRI script, which is done through a dropdown on the copy icon. This is a well defined UX, and needs to be reconsidered during development.

I am aware of the GitHub issues related to this, and will work to modify and improve this as it's developed.


### Tutorials

This tutorials section is intended to be straight forward. Tutorial link, author profile, and show a no-content with a guide to make a tutorial if none exist.
